# smart-energy-meter
This project involves the development of a Smart Energy Meter using an ESP32 microcontroller, a PZEM-004T energy monitoring sensor, a relay, and a web server. The system is designed to provide real-time monitoring and control of electrical energy consumption. The ESP32 collects data from the PZEM-004T sensor, which measures voltage, current, power, and energy consumption. This data is then sent to a web server, where users can remotely access and monitor their energy usage through a user-friendly interface. Additionally, the relay allows for remote control of connected electrical appliances, enabling users to reduce their energy consumption efficiently.

### Objectives
- Accurate Energy Monitoring: Utilize the PZEM-004T sensor to measure voltage, current, power, and energy consumption with high precision.
- Remote Data Access: Implement a web server on the ESP32 to display real-time energy metrics and historical data through a user-friendly web interface.
- Control Mechanism: Integrate a relay module to remotely control electrical appliances based on energy consumption
- Alerts and Notifications: Set up alerts for unusual energy usage, helping users to identify and mitigate potential issues.

### Components
- ESP32 Microcontroller: The core of the system, responsible for data processing, web server hosting, and communication with other components.
- PZEM-004T Energy Meter: A precise sensor module for measuring voltage, current, power, and energy consumption.
- Relay Module: Allows the ESP32 to control high-voltage appliances, enabling automation and energy-saving features.
- Web Server Interface: Hosted on the ESP32, providing a dashboard for monitoring energy usage and controlling connected devices.

### Features
- Real-Time Monitoring: Continuously track and display energy metrics, including voltage, current, power, and total energy consumption.
- Web-Based Interface: Access energy data and control devices from any web browser, making the system accessible from anywhere.
- Alerts and Notifications: Configure the system to send alerts for abnormal energy consumption, helping users to take timely actions.
